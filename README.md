# Anubis Kernel for SphinxOS

The **Anubis Kernel** is a Python-based simulation framework designed for modeling 6D Cyclical Scalar Holographic Adaptive (CSA) spacetime, implementing the ER=EPR conjecture through quantum entanglement and Einstein-Rosen bridges. It supports quantum communication via wormhole nodes and digital physical Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs) within the SphinxOS environment. Optimized for mobile execution (e.g., Python3IDE.app), it uses a compact grid size `(4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2)` and includes robust error handling.

## Features

- **6D CSA Spacetime Simulation**: Models a 6D geometry with temporal, spatial, and extra dimensions, incorporating GÃ¶del-inspired metrics.
- **ER=EPR Conjecture**: Demonstrates entanglement-throat area correlations using EPR pairs and wormhole connections.
- **Quantum Communication**: Implements secure messaging via `TesseractMessenger` using ECDSA cryptography and qutrit-based encoding.
- **CTC Quantum Circuit**: Simulates digital physical CTCs with qutrit Hadamard, CNOT, CPHASE, CZ, and SWAP gates.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Lightweight configuration for resource-constrained devices.
- **Visualizations**: Generates plots for tetrahedral networks, field slices, and ER=EPR metrics.
- **Checkpointing**: Saves and loads simulation states for continuity.
